# Safety Beacon

> Term project for Group #7 (Team NeuroSoftware) in CMPT 275: Software Engineering I

## Description

Alzheimerâ€™s is a disease that effects not only the patient but everyone who is close to them. You may find yourself worried that your family members might one day forget where they live and wonder off. Or maybe you are worried that they are taking too many trips to the pharmacy buying over the counter drugs or the casino spending their money and not remembering how much they lost. While you may not always be able to be by their side, with *Safety Beacon* you can rest easy knowing you have a direct link to their current and previous whereabouts.

### Features

- Real-Time Location Access; *in case they go missing*

- A daily safety report
- A saved list of important locations; *to add map markers like home or the grocery store*
- A shared calendar; *to remind the PATIENT to fill a perscription or attend their doctor's appointment*

While also providing convenience features to the PARIENT like:

- A simple map view with easy navigation to the list of important locations; *because Google Maps complicated if you forget where you need to go*
- A "panic" button that will guide them home if they are ever lost and alert the CARETAKER
